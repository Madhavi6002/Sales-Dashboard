# Sales-Dashboard
Powerbi dashboard
A monthly sales dashboard makes monitoring progress easy and accessible to your entire team. When your sales team has access to the business targets and current performance, it creates transparency and alignment within the department. The team no longer has to rely on weekly status reports from an Excel sheet that has to be updated continuously.
